# Hello-world
For practicing as a first-timer in GitHub
Hi, I am @kndure.
I am interested in data analytics.
I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate program through Coursera.
I am looking forward to collaborating with other data analytics.
I am available on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kebba-ndure-6781382ba?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BosKJyi%2FmSHqSmZY98T1oGg%3D%3D).
My working email address is "kebbandure06@gmail.com".
I enjoy working with competitors in the Kaggle competition.
My favorite data analysis tool is R, especially using R Markdown to document my work and build stakeholder reports.
